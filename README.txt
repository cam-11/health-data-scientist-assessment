# Health Data Scientist Practical Assessment

This repository contains my solution to a health data analysis practical assessment focused on transforming raw medicine dispensing and laboratory data into a patient-level dataset suitable for reporting and analysis.

## Overview

The objective was to construct a wide dataset with one row per patient by integrating multiple healthcare data sources. The workflow includes data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and feature engineering using Python and pandas.

## Files Included

**health_data_scientist_practical_assessment.ipynb**
Jupyter notebook showing the full step-by-step process, including data exploration, preparation, and validation.

**health_data_scientist_practical_assessment.py**
Python script version of the workflow, allowing the dataset to be generated in a reproducible pipeline.

**wide_patient_dataset.csv**
Final patient-level dataset containing demographic information, medicine dispensing summaries, laboratory results, and follow-up indicators.

## Key Tasks Completed

* Cleaned and standardized patient demographic data
* Aggregated medicine dispensing records per patient
* Extracted latest HbA1c laboratory results
* Created age categories and treatment indicators
* Built a wide dataset suitable for reporting and analysis
* Generated visualisations to support healthcare insights

## Technologies Used

* Python
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome

This project demonstrates the ability to work with healthcare datasets, perform data engineering tasks, and produce structured outputs to support clinical reporting and decision-making.
